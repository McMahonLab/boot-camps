## Setup

This setup will help you install git and a text editor.  

Sarah uses [Atom](https://atom.io/) and
[Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
but you are welcome to use your own text editor of choice.
If you don't use a command line editor, please follow the editor install instructions below
for your particular operating system.

#### Git

Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
lets you track who made changes to what when and has
options for easily updating a shared or public version of
your code on [github.com](https://github.com/).

### Windows

#### Git Bash

Install Git for Windows by downloading and running
[the installer](http://msysgit.github.io/).
This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.

#### Software Carpentry Installer

After installing Git Bash:

- Download the [installer](http://files.software-carpentry.org/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe).
  (This installer requires an active internet connection.)
- If the file opens directly in the browser select **File &rarr; Save Page As**
  to download it to your computer.
- Double click on the file to run it.

#### Editor

`nano` is the editor installed by the Software Carpentry Installer.
It is a basic editor integrated into the lesson material.
You can also install [Atom](https://atom.io/), if you prefer.

### Mac OS X

#### Editor

We recommend
[Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) or
[Atom](https://atom.io/).
You can also use `nano`,
which should be pre-installed.

#### Git

Install Git for Mac 10.8 (Mavericks or newer) by downloading and running
[the installer](http://git-scm.com/downloads).  If you haven't upgraded to Mavericks or newer and have a university owned computer, please do so ASAP.  If you have questions on how to do this, ask Sarah.
For older
versions of OS X (10.6-10.8, before Mavericks) on personal computers use the most recent available
installer for Snow Leopard [available
here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).  


### Linux

#### Git

If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
to install it via your distribution's package manager
(e.g. `apt-get` or `yum`).

#### Editor

[Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are options for Linux users.  
You can also use `nano`,
which should be pre-installed.
