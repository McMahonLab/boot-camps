You will need to bring a laptop to all sessions of the workshop. It is strongly encouraged 
that participants already have a basic understanding of programming concepts, like loops, 
conditionals, and arrays. Before you arrive, please 
[follow the instructions to install python and other software](setup/README.md).

<a name="schedule"></a>Schedule
-----------

This workshop has been structured around the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745)" by G. Wilson,
et al (at the top of this repository). In so doing, the sessions names 
have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early in the research process. 
Please note that this schedule is subject to minor changes by the start of the workshop.
