This workshop emphasizes the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745)" by G. Wilson,
et al (at the top of this repository). The sessions names
have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early in the research process.
Please note that this schedule is subject to minor changes by the start of the workshop.
